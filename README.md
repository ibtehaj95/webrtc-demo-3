# webrtc-demo-3
SFU Demo by Coding with Chaim (https://youtu.be/GMbdEnK8h3U?si=JPHRwTLvfPl0czYw)

I have done this using React, whereas the original version was done with HTML and Vanilla JS

Instructions for Setup:

To install, please run npm install in both the frontend and the backend folders

Instructions for Running:

Please run bash scripts/start.sh in the main directory (webrtc-demo-3)

For viewing the unidirectional code, please use the main branch, for bidirectional code, please use the bidirectional branch

Unidirectional: Just one can send, the other has to listen. One tab starts stream, the other one then views the stream

Bidirectional: Both (tabs) first start, by clicking on "I'm one" and "I'm two", respectvely. First one then clicks "start stream" beneath the button they pressed, second presses "start stream" beneath their button
